<h1 class="appendix">A. Plans and Ideas</h1>

<p>This appendix contains some tentative plans and ideas for improving
Proof General.
</p>
<p>This appendix is no longer extended: instead we keep a list of Proof
General projects on the web, and forthcoming plans and ideas in the
&lsquo;<tt>TODO</tt>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<tt>todo</tt>&rsquo; files included in the ordinary and
developers PG distributions, respectively.  Once the items mentioned
below are implemented, they will be removed from here.
</p>
<p>Please send us contributions to our wish lists, or better still, an
offer to implement something from them!

<h2 class="section">A.1 Proof by pointing and similar features</h2>
<a class="anchor" id="index-proof-by-pointing"></a>

<p>This is a note by David Aspinall about proof by pointing and similar
features.
</p>
<p>Proof General already supports proof by pointing, and experimental
support was provided in LEGO.  We would like to extend this support to
other proof assistants.  Unfortunately, proof by pointing requires
rather heavy support from the proof assistant.  There are two aspects to
the support:
</p><ul>
<li> term structure mark-up
</li><li> proof by pointing command generation
</li></ul>
<p>Term structure mark-up is useful in itself: it allows the user to
explore the structure of a term using the mouse (the smallest
subexpression that the mouse is over is highlighted), and easily copy
subterms from the output to a proof script.
</p>
<p>Command generation for proof by pointing is usually specific to a
particular logic in use, if we hope to generate a good proof command
unambiguously for any particular click. However, Proof General could
easily be generalised to offer the user a context-sensitive choice of
next commands to apply, which may be more useful in practice, and a
worthy addition to Proof General.
</p>
<p>Implementors of new proof assistants should be encouraged to consider
supporting term-structure mark up from the start.  Command generation
should be something that the logic-implementor can specify in some way.
</p>
<p>Of the supported provers, we can certainly hope for proof-by-pointing
support from Coq, since the CtCoq proof-by-pointing code has been moved
into the Coq kernel lately.  I hope the Coq community can encourage
somebody to do this.

<h2 class="section">A.2 Granularity of atomic command sequences</h2>
<a class="anchor" id="index-ACS-_0028Atomic-Command-Sequence_0029"></a>

<p>This is a proposal by Thomas Kleymann for generalising the way Proof
General handles sequences of proof commands (see <i>Goal-save
sequences</i> in the user manual), particularly to make retraction more flexible.
</p>
<p>The blue region of a script buffer contains the initial segment of
the proof script which has been processed successfully. It consists of
atomic sequences of commands (ACS). Retraction is supported to the
beginning of every ACS. By default, every command is an ACS. But the
granularity of atomicity should be able to be adjusted.
</p>
<p>This is essential when arbitrary retraction is not supported. Usually,
after a theorem has been proved, one may only retract to the start of
the goal. One needs to mark the proof of the theorem as an ACS. At
present, support for goal-save sequences (see <i>Goal-save sequences</i> in
the user manual), has been hard wired. No other ACS are currently
supported. We propose the following to overcome this deficiency:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt> <code>proof-atomic-sequents-list</code>
<a class="anchor" id="index-proof_002datomic_002dsequents_002dlist"></a>
</dt>
<dd><p>is a list of instructions for setting up ACSs. Each instruction is a
list of the form <code>(<var>end</var> <var>start</var> &amp;optional
<var>forget-command</var>)</code>. <var>end</var> is a regular expression to recognise
the last command in an ACS. <var>start</var> is a function. Its input is the
last command of an ACS. Its output is a regular expression to recognise
the first command of the ACS. It is evaluated once and, starting with the
command matched by <var>end</var>, the output is
successively matched against previously processed commands until a match
occurs (or the beginning of the current buffer is reached). The region
determined by (<var>start</var>,<var>end</var>) is locked as an ACS. Optionally,
the ACS is annotated with the actual command to retract the ACS. This is 
computed by applying <var>forget-command</var> to the first and last command
of the ACS.
</p>
<p>For convenience one might also want to allow <var>start</var> to be the
symbol &lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo; as a convenient short-hand for <code>'(lambda (str)
&quot;.&quot;)</code> which always matches.

<h2 class="section">A.3 Browser mode for script files and theories</h2>

<p>This is a proposal by David Aspinall for a browser window.
</p>
<p>A browser window should provide support for browsing script files and
theories.  We should be able to inspect data in varying levels of
detail, perhaps using outlining mechanisms.  For theories, it would be
nice to query the running proof assistant.  This may require support
from the assistant in the form of output which has been specially
marked-up with an SGML like syntax, for example.
</p>
<p>A browser would be useful to:
</p><ul>
<li> Provide impoverished proof assistants with a browser
</li><li> Extend the uniform interface of Proof General to theory browsing 
</li><li> Interact closely with proof script writing
</li></ul>
<p>The last point is the most important. We should be able to integrate a
search mechanism for proofs of similar theorems, theorems containing
particular constants, etc.
