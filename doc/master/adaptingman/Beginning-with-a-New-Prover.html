<h1 class="chapter">1. Beginning with a New Prover</h1>

<p>Proof General has about 100 configuration variables which are set on a
per-prover basis to configure the various features.  It may sound like a
lot but don&rsquo;t worry!  Many of the variables occur in pairs (typically
regular expressions matching the start and end of some text), and you
can begin by setting just a fraction of the variables to get the basic
features of script management working.  The bare minimum for a working
prototype is about 25 simple settings.
</p>
<p>For more advanced features you may need (or want) to write some Emacs
Lisp.  If you&rsquo;re adding new functionality please consider making it
generic for different proof assistants, if appropriate.  When writing
your modes, please follow the Emacs Lisp conventions, see <a href="../Elisp/Tips.html#Tips">(Elisp)Tips</a>.
</p>
<p>The configuration variables are declared in the file
&lsquo;<tt>generic/proof-config.el</tt>&rsquo;.  The details in the central part of this
manual are based on the contents of that file, beginning in <a href="/doc/master/adaptingman/Menus-and-Toolbar-and-User_002dlevel-Commands#Menus-and-Toolbar-and-User_002dlevel-Commands">Menus, toolbar, and user-level commands</a>, and continuing until <a href="/doc/master/adaptingman/Global-Constants#Global-Constants">Global Constants</a>.
Other chapters cover the details of configuring for multiple files and
for supporting the other Emacs packages mentioned in the user manual
(<i>Support for other Packages</i>).  If you write additional Elisp code
interfacing to Proof General, you can find out about some useful functions
by reading <a href="/doc/master/adaptingman/Writing-More-Lisp-Code#Writing-More-Lisp-Code">Writing More Lisp Code</a>.  The last chapter of this
manual describes some of the internals of Proof General, in case you are
interested, maybe because you need to extend the generic core to do
something new.
</p>
<p>In the rest of this chapter we describe the general mechanisms for
instantiating Proof General.  We assume some knowledge of the content
of the main Proof General manual.

<h2 class="section">1.1 Overview of adding a new prover</h2>

<p>Each proof assistant supported has its own subdirectory under
<code>proof-home-directory</code>, used to store a root elisp file and any
other files needed to adapt the proof assistant for Proof General.
</p>

<p>Here is how to go about adding support for a new prover.
</p>
<ol>
<li> Make a directory called &lsquo;<tt>myassistant/</tt>&rsquo; under the Proof General home
directory <code>proof-home-directory</code>, to put the specific customization
and associated files in.
</li><li> Add a file &lsquo;<tt>myassistant.el</tt>&rsquo; to the new directory.
</li><li> Edit &lsquo;<tt>proof-site.el</tt>&rsquo; to add a new entry to the
  <code>proof-assistants-table</code> variable.  The new entry should look
like this:
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="lisp">    (myassistant &quot;My Proof Assistant&quot; &quot;\\.myasst$&quot;)
</pre></td></tr></table>
   
<p>The first item is used to form the name of the internal variables for
the new mode as well as the directory and file where it loads from.  The
second is a string, naming the proof assistant.  The third item is a
regular expression to match names of proof script files for this
assistant.  See the documentation of <code>proof-assistant-table</code> for
more details.
</p></li><li> Define the new Proof General modes in &lsquo;<tt>myassistant.el</tt>&rsquo;, 
 by setting configuration variables to customize the
 behaviour of the generic modes.  
</li></ol>


<dl>
<dt><a class="anchor" id="index-proof_002dassistant_002dtable"></a><u>Variable:</u> <b>proof-assistant-table</b></dt>
<dd><p>Proof General&rsquo;s table of supported proof assistants.<br>
This is copied from &lsquo;<samp><code>proof-assistant-table-default</code></samp>&rsquo; at load time,
removing any entries that do not have a corresponding directory
under &lsquo;<samp><code>proof-home-directory</code></samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Each entry is a list of the form
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="lisp">  (<var>symbol</var> <var>name</var> <var>file-extension</var> [AUTOMODE-REGEXP] [IGNORED-EXTENSIONS-LIST])
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>The <var>name</var> is a string, naming the proof assistant.
The <var>symbol</var> is used to form the name of the mode for the
assistant, &lsquo;<samp>SYMBOL-mode</samp>&rsquo;, run when files with <var>automode-regexp</var>
(or with extension <var>file-extension</var>) are visited.  If present,
<var>ignored-extensions-list</var> is a list of file-name extensions to be
ignored when doing file-name completion (<var>ignored-extensions-list</var>
is added to &lsquo;<samp><code>completion-ignored-extensions</code></samp>&rsquo;).
</p>
<p><var>symbol</var> is also used to form the name of the directory and elisp
file for the mode, which will be
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="lisp">    <var>proof-home-directory</var>/<var>symbol</var>/<var>symbol</var>.el
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>where <var>proof-home-directory</var> is the value of the
variable &lsquo;<samp><code>proof-home-directory</code></samp>&rsquo;.
</p></dd></dl>


<p>The final step of the description above is where the work lies.  There
are two basic methods.  You can write some Emacs lisp functions and
define the modes using the macro <code>define-derived-mode</code>.  Or you can
use the new easy configuration mechanism of Proof General 3.0 described
in the next section, which calls <code>define-derived-mode</code> for you.
You still need to know which configuration variables should be set, and
how to set them.  
</p>
<p>The documentation below (and inside Emacs) should help with that, but
the best way to begin might be to use an existing Proof General instance
as an example.  
</p>

<hr size="6">
<a class="anchor" id="Demonstration-instance-and-easy-configuration"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="Demonstration-instance-and-easy-configuration-1"></a>
<h2 class="section">1.2 Demonstration instance and easy configuration</h2>

<p>Proof General is supplied with a demonstration instance for Isabelle
which configures the basic features.  This is a whittled down version of
Isabelle Proof General, which you can use as a template to get support
for a new assistant going.  Check the directory &lsquo;<tt>demoisa</tt>&rsquo; for the
two files &lsquo;<tt>demoisa.el</tt>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<tt>demoisa-easy.el</tt>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>The file &lsquo;<tt>demoisa.el</tt>&rsquo; follows the scheme described in <a href="#Major-modes-used-by-Proof-General">Major modes used by Proof General</a>.  It uses the Emacs Lisp macro
<code>define-derived-mode</code> to define the four modes for a Proof General
instance, by inheriting from the generic code.  Settings which configure
Proof General are made by functions called from within each mode, as
appropriate.
</p>
<p>The file &lsquo;<tt>demoisa-easy.el</tt>&rsquo; uses a new simplified mechanism to
achieve (virtually) the same result.  It uses the macro
<code>proof-easy-config</code> defined in &lsquo;<tt>proof-easy-configl.el</tt>&rsquo; to make
all of the settings for the Proof General instance in one go, defining
the derived modes automatically using a regular naming scheme.  No lisp
code is used in this file except the call to this macro.  The minor
difference in the end result is that all the variables are set at once,
rather than inside each mode.  But since the configuration variables are
all global variables anyway, this makes no real difference.
</p>
<p>The macro <code>proof-easy-config</code> is called like this:
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="lisp">   (proof-easy-config <var>myprover</var> &quot;<var>MyProver</var>&quot;
        <var>config_1</var> <var>val_1</var>
        ...
        <var>config_n</var> <var>val_n</var>)
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>The main body of the macro call is like the body of a <code>setq</code>.  It
contains pairs of variables and value settings.  The first argument to
the macro is a symbol defining the mode root, the second argument is a
string defining the mode name.  These should be the same as the first
part of the entry in <code>proof-assistant-table</code> for your prover.
See section <a href="#Overview-of-adding-a-new-prover">Overview of adding a new prover</a>.  After the call to
<code>proof-easy-config</code>, the new modes <code><var>myprover</var>-mode</code>,
<code><var>myprover</var>-shell-mode</code>, <code><var>myprover</var>-response-mode</code>,
and <code><var>myprover</var>-goals-mode</code> will be defined.  The configuration
variables in the body will be set immediately.
</p>

<p>This mechanism is in fact recommended for new instantiations of
Proof General since it follows a regular pattern, and we can more
easily adapt it in the future to new versions of Proof General.
</p>
<p>Even Emacs Lisp experts should prefer the simplified mechanism.  If you
want to set some buffer-local variables in your Proof General modes, or
invoke supporting lisp code, this can easily be done by adding functions
to the appropriate mode hooks after the <code>proof-easy-config</code> call.
For example, to add extra settings for the shell mode for
<code>demoisa</code>, we could do this:
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="lisp">   (defun demoisa-shell-extra-config ()
      <var>extra configuration ...</var>
    )
   (add-hook 'demoisa-shell-mode-hook 'demoisa-shell-extra-config)
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>The function to do extra configuration <code>demoisa-shell-extra-config</code>
is then called as the final step when <code>demoisa-shell-mode</code> is
entered (be wary, this will be after the generic
<code>proof-shell-config-done</code> is called, so it will be too late to set
normal configuration variables which may be examined by
<code>proof-shell-config-done</code>).
</p>

<hr size="6">
<a class="anchor" id="Major-modes-used-by-Proof-General"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="Major-modes-used-by-Proof-General-1"></a>
<h2 class="section">1.3 Major modes used by Proof General</h2>

<p>There are four major modes used by Proof General, one for each type of
buffer it handles.  The buffer types are: script, shell, response and
goals.  Each of these has a generic mode, respectively:
<code>proof-mode</code>, <code>proof-shell-mode</code>, <code>proof-response-mode</code>,
and <code>proof-goals-mode</code>.
</p>
<p>The pattern for defining the major mode for an instance of Proof General
is to use <code>define-derived-mode</code> to define a specific mode to inherit from
each generic one, like this:
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="lisp">(define-derived-mode myass-shell-mode proof-shell-mode
   &quot;MyAss shell&quot; nil
   (myass-shell-config)
   (proof-shell-config-done))
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Where <code>myass-shell-config</code> is a function which sets the
configuration variables for the shell (see section <a href="/doc/master/adaptingman/Proof-Shell-Settings#Proof-Shell-Settings">Proof Shell Settings</a>).
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important that each of your modes invokes one of the functions
 <code>proof-config-done</code>,
 <code>proof-shell-config-done</code>, 
 <code>proof-response-config-done</code>, or
 <code>proof-goals-config-done</code>
once it has set its configuration variables.  These functions
finalize the configuration of the mode.
</p>
<p>The modes must be named standardly, replacing <code>proof-</code> with the
prover&rsquo;s symbol name, <code><var>PA</var>-</code>.  In other words, you must define
<code><var>PA</var>-mode</code>, <code><var>PA</var>-shell-mode</code>, etc.
</p>
<p>See the file &lsquo;<tt>demoisa.el</tt>&rsquo; for an example of the four calls to
<code>define-derived-mode</code>.
</p>
<p>Aside: notice that the modes are selected using stub functions
inside <code>proof-site.el</code>, which set the variables
<code>proof-mode-for-script</code>, <code>proof-mode-for-shell</code>, etc,
that actually select the right mode.  These variables
are declared in <code>pg-vars.el</code>.
