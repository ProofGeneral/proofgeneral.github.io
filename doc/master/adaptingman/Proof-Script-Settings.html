<h2 class="section">3.1 Recognizing commands and comments</h2>

<p>The first four settings configure the generic parsing strategy for
commands in the proof script.  Usually only one of these three needs to
be set.  If the generic parsing functions are not flexible for your
needs, you can supply a value for <code>proof-script-parse-function</code>.
</p>
<p>Note that for the generic functions to work properly, it is
<strong>essential</strong> that you set the syntax table for your mode properly,
so that comments and strings are recognized.  See the Emacs
documentation to discover how to do this (particularly for the function
<code>modify-syntax-entry</code>, (see <a href="../Elisp/Syntax-Tables.html#Syntax-Tables">(Elisp)Syntax Tables</a>).
</p>
<p>See section <a href="/doc/master/adaptingman/Internals-of-Proof-General#Proof-script-mode">Proof script mode</a>, for more details of the parsing
functions.
</p>
<dl>

<dd><p>String that terminates commands sent to prover; nil if none.
</p>
<p>To configure command recognition properly, you must set at least one

&lsquo;<samp><code>proof-script-command-start-regexp</code></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><code>proof-terminal-string</code></samp>&rsquo;,

You should set this variable in script mode configuration.
</p>
<p>To configure command recognition properly, you must set at least one

You should set this variable in script mode configuration.
</p>
<p>The end of the command is considered to be the end of the match
of this regexp.  The regexp may include a nested group, which
can be used to recognize the start of the following command
(or white space).  If there is a nested group, the end of the
command is considered to be the start of the nested group,
i.e. (<code>match-beginning</code> 1), rather than (<code>match-end</code> 0).
</p>
<p>To configure command recognition properly, you must set at least one
of these: &lsquo;<samp><code>proof-script-sexp-commands</code></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><code>proof-script-command-end-regexp</code></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><code>proof-script-command-start-regexp</code></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><code>proof-terminal-string</code></samp>&rsquo;,
or &lsquo;<samp><code>proof-script-parse-function</code></samp>&rsquo;.
</p></dd></dl>


<p>The next four settings configure the comment syntax.  Notice that to get
reliable behaviour of the parsing functions, you may need to modify the
syntax table for your prover&rsquo;s mode.  
Read the Elisp manual (see <a href="../Elisp/Syntax-Tables.html#Syntax-Tables">(Elisp)Syntax Tables</a>) for details about that.

The script buffer&rsquo;s &lsquo;<samp><code>comment-start</code></samp>&rsquo; is set to this string plus a space.
Moreover, comments are usually ignored during script management, and not
sent to the proof process.

The default value is nil.  If your prover has a case <strong>insensitive</strong>
input syntax, &lsquo;<samp><code>proof-case-fold-search</code></samp>&rsquo; should be set to t instead.
NB: This setting is not used for matching output from the prover.
</p></dd></dl>


<p>Finally, the function <code>proof-looking-at-syntactic-context</code> is used
internally to help determine the syntactic structure of the buffer.
You can test it to check the settings above.  If necessary, you can
override this with a system-specific function.

<p>Several settings each may be supplied for recognizing goal-like and
save-like commands.  The <code>-with-hole-</code> settings are used to make a
record of the name of the theorem proved.
</p>
<p>The <code>-p</code> subsidiary predicates were added to allow more
discriminating behaviour for particular proof assistants.  (This is a
typical example of where the core framework needs some additional
generalization, to simplify matters, and allow for a smooth handling of
nested proofs; the present state is only part of the way there).

<p>This is added as a more refined addition to &lsquo;<samp><code>proof-goal-command-regexp</code></samp>&rsquo;,

<dd><p>Indicates how Proof General treats commands beyond the end of a proof.<br>
Normally goal...save regions are &quot;closed&quot;, i.e. made atomic for undo.
But once a proof has been completed, there may be a delay before
the &quot;save&quot; command appears &mdash; or it may not appear at all.  Unless
nested proofs are supported, this can spoil the undo-behaviour in
script management since once a new goal arrives the old undo history
may be lost in the prover.  So we allow Proof General to close
off the goal..[save] region in more flexible ways.
The possibilities are:
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="lisp">        nil  -  nothing special; close only when a save arrives
  <code>'closeany</code>  -  close as soon as the next command arrives, save or not
 <code>'closegoal</code>  -  close when the next &quot;goal&quot; command arrives
    <code>'extend</code>  -  keep extending the closed region until a save or goal.
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>If your proof assistant allows nested goals, it will be wrong to close
off the portion of proof so far, so this variable should be set to nil.
</p>
<p>NB: <code>'extend</code> behaviour is not currently compatible with appearance of
save commands, so don&rsquo;t use that if your prover has save commands.

<h2 class="section">3.5 Nested proofs</h2>

<p>Proof General allows configuration for provers which have particular
notions of nested proofs.  The right thing may happen automatically,
or you may need to adjust some of the following settings.
</p>
<p>First, you should alter the next setting if the prover retains history
for nested proofs.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="anchor" id="index-proof_002dnested_002dgoals_002dhistory_002dp"></a><u>Variable:</u> <b>proof-nested-goals-history-p</b></dt>
<dd><p>Whether the prover supports recovery of history for nested proofs.<br>
If it does (non-nil), Proof General will retain history inside
nested proofs.
If it does not, Proof General will amalgamate nested proofs into single
steps within the outer proof.
</p></dd></dl>
<p>Second, it may happen (i.e. it does for Coq) that the prover has a
history mechanism which necessitates keeping track of the number of
nested &quot;undoable&quot; commands, even if the history of the proof itself is
lost.  
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="anchor" id="index-proof_002dnested_002dundo_002dregexp"></a><u>Variable:</u> <b>proof-nested-undo-regexp</b></dt>
<dd><p>Regexp for commands that must be counted in nested goal-save regions.
</p>
<p>Used for provers which allow nested atomic goal-saves, but with some
nested history that must be undone specially.
</p>
<p>At the moment, the behaviour is that a goal-save span has a <code>'nestedundos</code>
property which is set to the number of commands within it which match
this regexp.  The idea is that the prover-specific code can create a
customized undo command to retract the goal-save region, based on the
<code>'nestedundos</code> setting.  Coq uses this to forget declarations, since
declarations in Coq reside in a separate context with its own (flat)
history.
</p></dd></dl>

<a class="anchor" id="Omitting-proofs-for-speed"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="Omitting-proofs-for-speed-1"></a>
<h2 class="section">3.6 Omitting proofs for speed</h2>

<p>In normal operation, the commands in an asserted region are sent
successively to the proof assistant. When the proof assistant
reports an error, processing stops. This ensures the consistency
of the development. Proof General supports omitting portions of
the asserted region to speed processing up at the cost of
consistency. Portions that can be potentially omitted are called
<em>opaque proofs</em> in Proof General, because usually only
opaque proofs (in the sense of Coq) can be omitted without
risking to break the following code. This feature is also
described in the Proof General manual, see <a href="../ProofGeneral/Script-processing-commands.html#Script-processing-commands">(ProofGeneral)Script processing commands</a> and
see <a href="../ProofGeneral/Omitting-proofs-for-speed.html#Omitting-proofs-for-speed">(ProofGeneral)Omitting proofs for speed</a>.
</p>
<p>The omit proofs feature works in a simple, straightforward way:
After parsing the asserted region, Proof General uses regular
expressions to search for commands that start
(<code>proof-script-proof-start-regexp</code>) and end
(<code>proof-script-proof-end-regexp</code>) an opaque proof. If one is
found, the opaque proof is replaced with a cheating command
(<code>proof-script-proof-admit-command</code>). From this description
it is immediate, that the omit proof feature does only work if
proofs are not nested. If a nested proof is found, a warning is
displayed and omitting proofs stops at that location for the
currently asserted region.
</p>
<p>In Coq, commands with non-local effects, such as <code>Hint</code>, may
appear inside proofs. Additionally, admitting a proof of a <code>Let</code>
declaration causes a warning in Coq. To treat such cases, the
predicate <code>proof-script-cmd-prevents-proof-omission</code> is applied
to all commands inside proofs and the regular expression
<code>proof-script-cmd-force-next-proof-kept</code> is matched against all
commands outside proofs. In case of a hit, the current or,
respectively, the next proof is treated as non-opaque and is not
omitted. Note that a match of
<code>proof-script-cmd-force-next-proof-kept</code> is only handled if the
matching command and the following proof appear in the same asserted
region. If the proof is asserted separately, the information about the
match in the previously asserted region is lost and the proof may thus
be omitted.
</p>
<p>To enable the omit proofs feature, the following settings must be
configured.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="anchor" id="index-proof_002domit_002dproofs_002dconfigured"></a><u>Variable:</u> <b>proof-omit-proofs-configured</b></dt>
<dd><p>t if the omit proofs feature has been configured by the proof assitant.<br>
See also &lsquo;<samp><code>proof-omit-proofs-option</code></samp>&rsquo; or the Proof General manual
for a description of the feature. This option can only be set, if
all of &lsquo;<samp><code>proof-script-proof-start-regexp</code></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><code>proof-script-proof-end-regexp</code></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><code>proof-script-definition-end-regexp</code></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><code>proof-script-proof-admit-command</code></samp>&rsquo; have been configured.
</p>
<p>The omit proofs feature skips over opaque proofs in the source
code, admitting the theorems, to speed up processing.
</p>
<p>If &lsquo;<samp><code>proof-omit-proofs-option</code></samp>&rsquo; is set by the user, all proof
commands in the source following a match of
&lsquo;<samp><code>proof-script-proof-start-regexp</code></samp>&rsquo; up to and including the next
match of &lsquo;<samp><code>proof-script-proof-end-regexp</code></samp>&rsquo;, are omitted (not send
to the proof assistant) and replaced by
&lsquo;<samp><code>proof-script-proof-admit-command</code></samp>&rsquo;. If a match for
&lsquo;<samp><code>proof-script-definition-end-regexp</code></samp>&rsquo; is found while searching
forward for the proof end or if
&lsquo;<samp><code>proof-script-cmd-prevents-proof-omission</code></samp>&rsquo; recognizes a proof
command that prevents proof omission then the current proof (up
to and including the match of
&lsquo;<samp><code>proof-script-definition-end-regexp</code></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><code>proof-script-proof-end-regexp</code></samp>&rsquo;) is considered to be not opaque
and not omitted, thus all these proof commands _are_ sent to the
proof assistant.
</p>
<p>The feature does not work for nested proofs. If a match for
&lsquo;<samp><code>proof-script-proof-start-regexp</code></samp>&rsquo; is found before the next match
for &lsquo;<samp><code>proof-script-proof-end-regexp</code></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><code>proof-script-definition-end-regexp</code></samp>&rsquo;, the search for opaque
proofs immediately stops and all commands following the previous
match of &lsquo;<samp><code>proof-script-proof-start-regexp</code></samp>&rsquo; are sent verbatim to
the proof assistant.
</p>
<p>All the regular expressions for this feature are matched against
the commands inside proof action items, that is as strings,
without surrounding space.

<h2 class="section">3.7 Proof status statistic</h2>

<p>The commands <code>proof-check-report</code> and <code>proof-check-annotate</code>
build on the omit-proofs feature. Using its machinery,
<code>proof-check-proofs</code>, the inner working horse of both commands,
splits the current buffer into opaque proofs and all other material.
The other material is asserted in the usual way and
<code>proof-check-proofs</code> aborts if it detects an error in there. For
opaque proofs it first tries to assert them in the usual way too. If
this succeeds the proof is considered valid. Otherwise the proof is
replaced with <code>proof-script-proof-admit-command</code> and the proof is
considered invalid. In order to consider Admitted proofs as invalid
ones, proofs whose last command matches
<code>proof-omit-cheating-regexp</code> count as invalid. To associate
theorem names with opaque proofs, the function
<code>proof-get-proof-info-fn</code> is called, which is identical to
<code>proof-tree-get-proof-info</code>, See section <a href="/doc/master/adaptingman/Configuring-Proof_002dTree-Visualization#Proof-Tree-Elisp-configuration">Proof Tree Elisp configuration</a>.

<p>When switching scripting from buffer A to buffer B Proof General
normally offers the choice of either completely retracting or
completely asserting buffer A. The option to completely assert
buffer A is offered, because the material in B may depend on A.
Even if B does not depend on A, it does no harm if one keeps the
development of A loaded in the proof assistant. This observation
is true for many proof assistants.
</p>
<p>One exception is Coq. Assume file B depends on file A. When Coq
processes B it does not read the sources of A. Instead it loads a
compiled object representation of A. Therefore, when switching
from A to B, it does make no sense to keep the material of A
loaded in the proof assistant. For Coq, the material of A may
even provoke errors on correct input. Therefore, for coq, the
right behaviour is to completely retract buffer A before
switching to B.
