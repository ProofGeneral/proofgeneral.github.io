<p><em>Proof General</em> is a generic Emacs interface for interactive proof
assistants,<a id="DOCF1" href="/doc/master/userman/ProofGeneral_fot#FOOT1">(1)</a> developed at the LFCS in
the University of Edinburgh.  
</p>
<p>You do not have to be an Emacs militant to use Proof General!  
</p>
<p>The interface is designed to be very easy to use.  You develop your
proof script<a id="DOCF2" href="/doc/master/userman/ProofGeneral_fot#FOOT2">(2)</a>
 in-place rather than line-by-line and later reassembling the pieces.
Proof General keeps track of which proof steps have been processed by
the prover, and prevents you editing them accidentally.  You can undo
steps as usual.
</p>
<p>The aim of Proof General is to provide a powerful and configurable
interface for numerous interactive proof assistants.  We target Proof
General mainly at intermediate or expert users, so that the interface
should be useful for large proof developments.  
</p>
<p>Please help us!
</p>
<p>Send us comments, suggestions, or (the best) patches to improve support
for your chosen proof assistant.  Contact us at
<a href="https://github.com/ProofGeneral/PG/issues">https://github.com/ProofGeneral/PG/issues</a>.
</p>
<p>If your chosen proof assistant isn&rsquo;t supported, read the accompanying
<i>Adapting Proof General</i> manual to find out how to configure PG for a
new prover.

<h2 class="section">1.1 Installing Proof General</h2>

<p>If Proof General has not already been installed for you, you should 
unpack it and insert the line:
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="lisp">        (load &quot;<var>proof-general-home</var>/generic/proof-site.el&quot;)
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>into your &lsquo;<tt>~/.emacs</tt>&rsquo; file, where <var>proof-general-home</var> is the
top-level directory that was created when Proof General was unpacked.
</p>
<p>For much more information, See section <a href="/doc/master/userman/Obtaining-and-Installing#Obtaining-and-Installing">Obtaining and Installing</a>.

<hr size="6">
<a class="anchor" id="Quick-start-guide"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="Quick-start-guide-1"></a>
<h2 class="section">1.2 Quick start guide</h2>

<p>Once Proof General is correctly installed, the corresponding Proof
General mode will be invoked automatically when you visit a proof
script file for your proof assistant, for example:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td width="35%"><b>Prover</b></td><td width="30%"><b>Extensions</b></td><td width="35%"><b>Mode</b></td></tr>
<tr><td width="35%">Coq</td><td width="30%">&lsquo;<tt>.v</tt>&rsquo;</td><td width="35%"><code>coq-mode</code></td></tr>
<tr><td width="35%">Phox</td><td width="30%">&lsquo;<tt>.phx</tt>&rsquo;</td><td width="35%"><code>phox-mode</code></td></tr>
<tr><td width="35%">PG-Shell</td><td width="30%">&lsquo;<tt>.pgsh</tt>&rsquo;</td><td width="35%"><code>pgshell-mode</code></td></tr>
<tr><td width="35%">EasyCrypt</td><td width="30%">&lsquo;<tt>.ec</tt>&rsquo;</td><td width="35%"><code>easycrypt-mode</code></td></tr>
</table>
<p>(the exact list of Proof Assistants supported may vary according to the
version of Proof General and its local configuration).  You can also
invoke the mode command directly, e.g., type <kbd>M-x coq-mode</kbd>, to
turn a buffer into a Coq script buffer.
</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find commands to process the proof script are available from the
toolbar, menus, and keyboard.  Type <kbd>C-h m</kbd> to get a list of the
keyboard shortcuts for the current mode.  The commands available should
be easy to understand, but the rest of this manual describes them in
some detail.
</p>
<p>The proof assistant itself is started automatically inside Emacs as an
&quot;inferior&quot; process when you ask for some of the proof script to be
processed.  You can start the proof assistant manually with the
menu command &quot;Start proof assistant&quot;.
</p>
<p>To follow an example use of Proof General on a Isabelle proof, 
see section <a href="/doc/master/userman/Basic-Script-Management#Walkthrough-example-in-Isabelle">Walkthrough example in Isabelle</a>.  If you know the syntax for proof
scripts in another theorem prover, you can easily adapt the details 
given there.

<h2 class="section">1.3 Features of Proof General</h2>
<a class="anchor" id="index-Features"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="index-Why-use-Proof-General_003f"></a>

<p>Why would you want to use Proof General?
</p>

<p>Proof General is designed to be useful for novices and expert users
alike.  It will be useful to you if you use a proof assistant, and you&rsquo;d
like an interface with the following features: simplified interaction,
script management, multiple file scripting, a script editing mode, proof
by pointing, proof-tree visualization,
toolbar and menus, syntax highlighting, real symbols,
functions menu, tags, and finally, adaptability.
</p>
<p>Here is an outline of some of these features.   Look in the contents
page or index of this manual to find out about the others!
</p>
<ul>
<li> <i>Simplified interaction</i><br>
  Proof General is designed for proof assistants which have a
  command-line shell interpreter.  When using Proof General, the proof
  assistant&rsquo;s shell is hidden from the user.  Communication takes
  place via three buffers (Emacs text widgets).
Communication takes place via three buffers.  The <em>script
buffer</em> holds input, the commands to construct a proof.  The <em>goals
buffer</em> displays the current list of subgoals to be solved.  The
<em>response buffer</em> displays other output from the proof assistant.
By default, only two of these three buffers are displayed. 
This means that the user normally only sees the output from the most
recent interaction, rather than a screen full of output from the proof
assistant.  

<p>Proof General does not commandeer the proof assistant shell: the user
still has complete access to it if necessary.
</p>
<p>For more details, see section <a href="/doc/master/userman/Basic-Script-Management#Summary-of-Proof-General-buffers">Summary of Proof General buffers</a>
and see section <a href="/doc/master/userman/Customizing-Proof-General#Display-customization">Display customization</a>.
</p>

</li><li> <i>Script management</i><br>
Proof General colours proof script regions blue when they have 
been processed by the prover, and colours regions red when the prover is
currently processing them.  The appearance of Emacs buffers always
matches the proof assistant&rsquo;s state. Coloured parts of the buffer cannot
be edited.  Proof General has functions for <em>asserting</em> or
<em>retracting</em> parts of a proof script, which alters the coloured
regions.

<p>For more details, see section <a href="/doc/master/userman/Basic-Script-Management#Basic-Script-Management">Basic Script Management</a>,
<a href="/doc/master/userman/Basic-Script-Management#Script-processing-commands">Script processing commands</a>,
and <a href="/doc/master/userman/Advanced-Script-Management-and-Editing#Advanced-Script-Management-and-Editing">Advanced Script Management and Editing</a>.
</p>
</li><li> <i>Script editing mode</i><br>
Proof General provides useful facilities for editing proof scripts,
including syntax hilighting and a menu to jump to particular goals,
definitions, or declarations.
Special editing functions send lines of proof script to the proof
assistant, or undo previous proof steps.

<p>For more details, see section <a href="/doc/master/userman/Basic-Script-Management#Script-editing-commands">Script editing commands</a>,
and <a href="/doc/master/userman/Basic-Script-Management#Script-processing-commands">Script processing commands</a>.
</p>
</li><li> <i>Proof-tree visualization</i><br>
In cooperation with the external program Prooftree
(available from the <a href="http://askra.de/software/prooftree/">Prooftree website</a>), Proof General can display proof trees
graphically and provide visual information about the proof status
of different branches in a proof. The proof-tree display provides
additional means for inspecting the proof tree and thus helps
against loosing track in proofs.

<p>The graphical proof-tree visualization is currently only
supported for Coq. For more details, see section <a href="/doc/master/userman/Graphical-Proof_002dTree-Visualization#Graphical-Proof_002dTree-Visualization">Graphical Proof-Tree Visualization</a>. 
</p>

</li><li> <i>Toolbar and menus</i><br>
A script buffer has a toolbar with navigation buttons for processing
parts of the proof script.  A menu provides further functions for
operations in the proof assistant, as well as customization of Proof
General.

<p>For more details, see section <a href="/doc/master/userman/Basic-Script-Management#Toolbar-commands">Toolbar commands</a>, <a href="/doc/master/userman/Basic-Script-Management#Proof-assistant-commands">Proof assistant commands</a>, and <a href="/doc/master/userman/Customizing-Proof-General#Customizing-Proof-General">Customizing Proof General</a>.
</p>
</li><li> <i>Proof by pointing</i><br>
Proof General has support for proof-by-pointing and similar features.
Proof by pointing allows you to click on a subterm of a goal to be
proved, and automatically apply an appropriate proof rule or tactic.
Proof by pointing is specific to the proof assistant (and logic) in use;
therefore it is configured mainly on the proof assistant side.  If you
would like to see proof by pointing support for Proof General in a
particular proof assistant, petition the developers of the proof
assistant to provide it.
</li></ul>

<a class="anchor" id="Supported-proof-assistants"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="Supported-proof-assistants-1"></a>
<h2 class="section">1.4 Supported proof assistants</h2>

<p>Proof General comes ready-customized for several
proof assistants, including these:
</p>
<ul>
<li> 
<b>Coq Proof General</b> for Coq Version 8.2<br>
See section <a href="/doc/master/userman/Coq-Proof-General#Coq-Proof-General">Coq Proof General</a>, for more details.
</li><li>
<b>EasyCrypt Proof General</b> for EasyCrypt<br>
See section <a href="/doc/master/userman/EasyCrypt-Proof-General#EasyCrypt-Proof-General">EasyCrypt Proof General</a>, for mode details.
</li><li>
<b>Shell Proof General</b> for shell scripts (not really a proof assistant!)<br>
See section <a href="/doc/master/userman/Shell-Proof-General#Shell-Proof-General">Shell Proof General</a>, for more details.
</li></ul>

<p>Proof General is designed to be generic, so if you know how
to write regular expressions, you can make:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Your Proof General</b> for your favourite proof assistant.<br>
For more details of how to make Proof General work
with another proof assistant,
see the accompanying manual <i>Adapting Proof General</i>.
</li></ul>

<p>The exact list of Proof Assistants supported may vary according to the
version of Proof General you have and its local configuration; only the
standard instances documented in this manual are listed above.
</p>
<p>Note that there is some variation between the features supported by
different instances of Proof General.  The main variation is proof by
pointing, which has been supported only in LEGO so far.  For advanced
features like this, some extensions to the output routines of the proof
assistant are required, typically.  If you like Proof General, <b>please
help us by asking the implementors of your favourite proof assistant to
support Proof General</b> as much as possible.

<a class="anchor" id="Prerequisites-for-this-manual-1"></a>
<h2 class="section">1.5 Prerequisites for this manual</h2>
<a class="anchor" id="index-Meta"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="index-Alt"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="index-key-sequences"></a>

<p>This manual assumes that you understand a little about using Emacs, for
example, switching between buffers using <kbd>C-x b</kbd> and understanding
that a key sequence like <kbd>C-x b</kbd> means &quot;control with x, followed by b&quot;.
A key sequence like <kbd>M-z</kbd> means &quot;meta with z&quot;.  (&lt;Meta&gt; may be
labelled &lt;Alt&gt; on your keyboard).
</p>
<p>The manual also assumes you have a basic understanding of your proof
assistant and the language and files it uses for proof scripts.  But
even without this, Proof General is not useless: you can use the
interface to <em>replay</em> proof scripts for any proof assistant without
knowing how to start it up or issue commands, etc.  This is the beauty
of a common interface mechanism.
</p>
<p>To get more from Proof General and adapt it to your liking, it helps to
know a little bit about how Emacs lisp packages can be customized via
the Customization mechanism.  It&rsquo;s really easy to use.  For details,
see section <a href="/doc/master/userman/Customizing-Proof-General#How-to-customize">How to customize</a>.  See <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Customization.html#Customization">(emacs)Customization</a>,
for documentation in Emacs.
</p>
<p>To get the absolute most from Proof General, to improve it or to adapt
it for new provers, you&rsquo;ll need to know a little bit of Emacs lisp.
Emacs is self-documenting, so you can begin from <kbd>C-h</kbd> and find out
everything!  Here are some useful commands:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt> <kbd>C-h i</kbd></dt>
<dd><p><code>info</code>
</p></dd>
<dt> <kbd>C-h m</kbd> </dt>
<dd><p><code>describe-mode</code>
</p></dd>
<dt> <kbd>C-h b</kbd> </dt>
<dd><p><code>describe-bindings</code>
</p></dd>
<dt> <kbd>C-h f</kbd> </dt>
<dd><p><code>describe-function</code>
</p></dd>
<dt> <kbd>C-h v</kbd> </dt>
<dd><p><code>describe-variable</code>
</p></dd>
</dl>
