<h2 class="section">10.2 Using the Coq project file</h2>
<a class="anchor" id="index-_005fCoqProject"></a>

<p>The Coq project file is the recommended way to configure the Coq
load path and the mapping of logical module names to physical
file path (-R,-Q,-I options). The project file is typically named
<code>_CoqProject</code> and must be located at the directory root of
your Coq project. Proof General searches for the Coq project file
starting at the current directory and walking the directory
structure upwards. The Coq project file contains the common
options (especially <code>-R</code>) and a list of the files of the
project, see the Coq reference manual, Section
<a href="https://coq.inria.fr/distrib/current/refman/practical-tools/utilities.html#building-a-coq-project">&ldquo;Building a Coq project&rdquo;</a>.
</p>


<p>The Coq project file should contain something like:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">-R foo bar
-I foo2
-arg -foo3
file.v
bar/other_file.v
...
</pre>
<p>Proof General only extracts the common options from the Coq
project file and uses them for <code>coqtop</code> background
processes as well as for <code>coqdep</code> and <code>coqc</code> when you use
the auto compilation feature, <a href="#Automatic-Compilation-in-Detail">Automatic Compilation in Detail</a>. For the example above, Proof General will start
<code>coqtop -emacs -foo3 -R foo bar -I foo2</code> (remark:
<code>-emacs</code> is always added to the options).
</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> <code>-arg</code> must be followed by one and only one option
to pass to coqtop/coqc, use several <code>-arg</code> to issue several
options. One per line (limitation of Proof General).
</p>
<p>For backward compatibility, one can also configure the load path
with the option <code>coq-load-path</code>, but this is not compatible
with <code>CoqIde</code> or <code>coq_makefile</code>.
</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> the Coq project file cannot define which version of
<code>coqtop</code> is launched. See section <a href="#Opam_002dswitch_002dmode-support">Opam-switch-mode support</a> for how to
switch between different Coq versions. Alternatively, for a fixed
version, you need either to launch emacs with the right executable in
the path or use file variables (see section <a href="/doc/master/userman/Hints-and-Tips#Using-file-variables">Using file variables</a> below or
see <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/File-Variables.html#File-Variables">(emacs)File Variables</a>) or directory variables,
see <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html#Directory-Variables">(emacs)Directory Variables</a>.

<a class="anchor" id="index-_002edir_002dlocals_002eel"></a>

<p>To change the name of the Coq project file, configure
<code>coq-project-filename</code> (select menu <code>Proof-General -&gt;
Advanced -&gt; Customize -&gt; Coq</code> and scroll down to &ldquo;Coq Project
Filename&rdquo;). Customizing <code>coq-project-filename</code> this way
will change the Coq project file name permanently and globally.
</p>
<p>If you only want to change the name of the Coq project file for
one project you can set the option as local file variable,
<a href="/doc/master/userman/Hints-and-Tips#Using-file-variables">Using file variables</a>. This can be done either directly in
every file or once for all files of a directory tree with a
<code>.dir-locals.el</code> file, see <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html#Directory-Variables">(emacs)Directory Variables</a>.
The file <code>.dir-locals.el</code> should then contain
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="lisp">((coq-mode . ((coq-project-filename . &quot;myprojectfile&quot;))))
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>Note that variables set in <code>.dir-locals.el</code> are automatically
made buffer local (such that files in different directories can
have their independent setting of <code>coq-project-filename</code>).
If you make complex customizations using <code>eval</code> in
<code>.dir-locals.el</code>, you might want to add appropriate calls to
<code>make-local-variable</code>.

<p>See its default value &lsquo;<samp><code>coq--default-project-find-file</code></samp>&rsquo; for an example.
</p>
<p>The function takes one argument, the name of a directory, and returns
the name of a coq/rocq project file it contains if there is one. Return
nil otherwise.
</p>
<p>This is used to detect the coq project file (using
&lsquo;<samp><code>locate-dominating-file</code></samp>&rsquo;). By default we accept _CoqProject and
_RocqProject (and any case-variant of these) without checking coq/rocq
version. If you want something smarter please redefine
&lsquo;<samp><code>coq-project-filename</code></samp>&rsquo; directly by using:

<p>About the coq/rocq project file (cf. Coq documentation on project files
and &quot;makefile generation&quot;):
</p>
<p>The coq project file of a coq development should contain the arguments
given to coq_makefile. In particular it contains the -I and -R
options (preferably one per line). If &lsquo;<samp>coq-use-coqproject</samp>&rsquo; is
t (default) the content of this file will be used by Proof General to
infer the &lsquo;<samp><code>coq-load-path</code></samp>&rsquo; and the &lsquo;<samp><code>coq-prog-args</code></samp>&rsquo; variables that set the
coqtop invocation by Proof General. This is now the recommended way of
configuring the coqtop invocation. Local file variables may still be
used to override the coq project file&rsquo;s configuration. .dir-locals.el
files also work and override project file settings.

<h2 class="section">10.3 Proof using annotations</h2>
<a class="anchor" id="index-Proof-using"></a>

<p>In order to process files asynchronously and pre-compile files (.vos and
.vok files), it is advised (inside sections) to list the section
variables (and hypothesis) on which each lemma depends on. This must be
done at the beginning of a proof with this syntax:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">Lemma foo: ... .
Proof using x y H1 H2.
</pre>
<p>If the annotation is missing, then at Qed time (i.e. later in the
script) coq complains with a warning and a suggestion of a correct
annotation that should be added. ProofGeneral intercepts this suggestion
and stores relevant information. Then depending on user preference it
can either
</p><ul>
<li> insert immediately the &ldquo;using...&rdquo; annotation after &ldquo;Proof&rdquo;,
without replaying the proof.
</li><li> highlight the place where the annotation should be inserted and
allow the user to perform the insertion later either via right click
menu on the proof or by <code>M-x coq-insert-suggested-dependency</code> (it
won&rsquo;t replay the proof)
</li><li> ask the user each time which of the two solutions above he wants
</li><li> ignore completely the suggestion. 
</li></ul>

<p>This can be configured either via Coq menu or by setting variable
<code>coq-accept-proof-using-suggestion</code> to one of the following values:
<code>'always</code>, <code>'highlight</code>, <code>'ask</code> or <code>'never</code>.

Proof General will compile the
necessary files whenever a <code>Require</code> command is processed. 
</p>
<p>The compilation feature does currently not support ML modules.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>There are actually two implementations of the Recompilation
feature. 
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt> Parallel asynchronous compilation (stable, default)</dt>
<dd><p>With parallel compilation, coqdep and coqc are launched in the
background and Proof General stays responsive during compilation.
Up to &lsquo;coq-max-background-compilation-jobs&rsquo; coqdep and coqc
processes may run in parallel. Compiled interfaces (<code>-vos</code>
for Coq 8.11 or newer) and quick compilation
(<code>-quick</code>/<code>-vio</code> for Coq 8.5 or newer) is
supported with various modes, <a href="#Quick-and-inconsistent-compilation">Quick and inconsistent compilation</a>.
</p></dd>
<dt> Synchronous single threaded compilation (obsolete)</dt>
<dd><p>With synchronous compilation, coqdep and coqc are called
synchronously for each Require command. Proof General is locked
until the compilation finishes. Neither quick nor vos compilation is
supported with synchronously compilation.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>To enable the automatic compilation feature, you have to follow
these points:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Set the option <code>coq-compile-before-require</code> (menu <code>Coq
-&gt; Auto Compilation -&gt; Compile Before Require</code>) to enable
compilation before processing <code>Require</code> commands. By
default, this enables parallel asynchronous compilation.
</li><li> 
Nonstandard load path elements <em>must</em> be configured via a
Coq project file (this is the recommended option),
<a href="#Using-the-Coq-project-file">Using the Coq project file</a> or via
option <code>coq-load-path</code>. <code>-I</code> or <code>-R</code> options in
<code>coq-prog-name</code> or <code>coq-prog-args</code> must be deleted.
</li><li>
Configure
<code>coq-max-background-compilation-jobs</code> if you want to limit
the number of parallel background jobs and set
<code>coq-compile-keep-going</code> (menu <code>Coq -&gt; Auto Compilation
-&gt; Keep going</code>) to let compilation continue after the first
error.
</li></ul>

<p>To abort parallel background compilation, use <code>C-c C-c</code>
(<code>proof-interrupt-process</code>), the tool bar interrupt icon,
the menu entry <code>Abort Background Compilation</code> (menu
<code>Coq -&gt; Auto Compilation</code>) or kill the Coq toplevel via
<code>C-c C-x</code> (<code>proof-shell-exit</code>). To abort synchronous
single threaded compilation, simply hit <code>C-g</code>.

<a class="anchor" id="Automatic-Compilation-in-Detail-1"></a>
<h3 class="subsection">10.4.1 Automatic Compilation in Detail</h3>

<p>When <code>coq-compile-before-require</code> is enabled, Proof
General looks for <code>Require</code> commands in text that gets
asserted (i.e., in text that is moved from the editing region to
the queue region, <a href="/doc/master/userman/Basic-Script-Management#Locked-queue-and-editing-regions">Locked, queue, and editing regions</a>). If
Proof General finds a <code>Require</code> command, it checks the
dependencies and (re-)compiles files as necessary. The Require
command and the following text is only sent to Coq after the
compilation has finished.
</p>
<p><code>Declare ML Module</code> commands are currently not recognized
and dependencies on ML Modules reported by <code>coqdep</code> are
ignored.
</p>
<p>Proof General uses <code>coqdep</code> to determine which libraries a
<code>Require</code> command will load and which files must be
up-to-date. Because Proof
General cannot know whether files are updated outside of Emacs,
it checks for every <code>Require</code> command the complete
dependency tree and recompiles files as necessary.
</p>
<p>Output from the compilation is only shown in case
of errors. It then appears in the buffer
<code>*coq-compile-response*</code>.
One can use <code>C-x `</code> (bound to <code>next-error</code>,
see <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Compilation-Mode.html#Compilation-Mode">(emacs)Compilation Mode</a>) to jump to error locations.
Sometimes the compilation commands do not produce error messages
with location information, then <code>C-x `</code> does only work in a
limited way.
</p>
<p>Proof General supports both vos and quick/vio
compilation to speed up compilation of required modules at the
price of consistency. Because quick/vio compilation does not seem
to have a benefit with vos compilation present, the former is
only supported for Coq before 8.11. Both can be configured via
the settings <code>coq-compile-vos</code> and <code>coq-compile-quick</code>
and via menu entries in <code>Coq -&gt; Auto Compilation</code>,
<a href="#Quick-and-inconsistent-compilation">Quick and inconsistent compilation</a>. 
</p>
<p>Similar to <code>make -k</code>, background compilation can be
configured to continue as far as possible after the first error,
see option <code>coq-compile-keep-going</code> (menu <code>Coq -&gt; Auto
Compilation -&gt; Keep going</code>). The keep-going option applies
to errors from <code>coqdep</code> and <code>coqc</code>. However, when
starting <code>coqc</code> or
<code>coqdep</code> fails), the compilation is immediately aborted.
</p>
<p>When a <code>Require</code> command causes a compilation of some files,
one may wish to save some buffers to disk beforehand. The option
<code>coq-compile-auto-save</code> controls how and which files are
saved. There are two orthogonal choices: One may wish to save all
or only the Coq source files, and, one may or may not want to
confirm the saving of each file. 
</p>
<p>With &lsquo;coq-compile-parallel-in-background&rsquo; (menu <code>Coq -&gt;
Settings -&gt; Compile Parallel In Background</code>) you can choose
between two implementations of internal compilation.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt> Synchronous single threaded compilation</dt>
<dd><p>This is the old, now outdated version supported since Proof General
4.1. This method starts coqdep and coqc processes one after each
other in synchronous subprocesses. Your Emacs session will be
locked until compilation finishes. Use <code>C-g</code> to interrupt
compilation. This method supports compilation via an external
command (such as <code>make</code>), see option
<code>coq-compile-command</code> in <a href="#Customizing-Coq-Multiple-File-Support">Customizing Coq Multiple File Support</a> below. Synchronous compilation does neither support
quick/vio nor vos compilation.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> Parallel asynchronous compilation</dt>
<dd><p>This is the newer, recommended
and default version added in Proof General version 4.3. It
runs up to <code>coq-max-background-compilation-jobs</code> coqdep and
coqc jobs in parallel in asynchronous subprocesses (or uses all
your CPU cores if <code>coq-max-background-compilation-jobs</code>
equals <code>'all-cpus</code>). Your Emacs will stay responsive during
compilation. To abort the background compilation process, use
<code>C-c C-c</code> (<code>proof-interrupt-process</code>), the tool bar
interrupt icon, the menu entry <code>Abort Background
Compilation</code> (menu <code>Coq -&gt; Auto Compilation</code>) or kill the
Coq toplevel via <code>C-c C-x</code> (<code>proof-shell-exit</code>).
</p>
<p>For the usual case, you have at most
&lsquo;coq-max-background-compilation-jobs&rsquo; parallel processes
<em>including</em> your Proof General process. The usual case
applies, when the Require commands are the first commands in the
file. If you have other commands between two Require commands or
before the first Require, then you may see Proof General and Coq
running in addition to &lsquo;coq-max-background-compilation-jobs&rsquo;
compilation jobs.
</p>
<p>Parallel asynchronous compilation supports both vos and quick/vio
compilation, but exclusively, depending on the Coq version,

checking. This means that ancestor locking does only work when
Proof General performs dependency checking and compilation
itself. If an external command is used, Proof General does not see
all dependencies and can therefore only lock direct ancestors.
</p>
<p>In the default setting,
when you want to edit a locked ancestor, you are
forced to completely retract the current scripting buffer. 
You can simplify this by setting <code>proof-strict-read-only</code> to
<code>'retract</code> (menu <code>Proof-General -&gt; Quick Options -&gt;
Read Only -&gt; Undo On Edit</code>). Then typing in some ancestor will
immediately retract your current scripting buffer and unlock that
ancestor.
</p>
<p>You have two choices, if you don&rsquo;t like ancestor locking in its
default way.
You can either switch ancestor locking completely off via
menu <code>Coq -&gt; Auto Compilation -&gt; Lock Ancestors</code> or
<code>coq-lock-ancestors</code> (<a href="#Customizing-Coq-Multiple-File-Support">Customizing Coq Multiple File Support</a>). Alternatively, you can generally permit editing in locked
sections with selecting 
<code>Proof-General</code> -&gt; <code>Quick Options</code> -&gt; <code>Read Only</code>
-&gt; <code>Freely Edit</code> (which will set the option
<code>proof-strict-read-only</code> to <code>nil</code>).
</p>

<p>[The right behaviour for Coq, namely to retract the current
scripting buffer only up to the appropriate <code>Require</code>
command, would be quite difficult to implement in the current
Proof General infrastructure. Further, it has only dubious
benefit, as Require commands are usually on the top of each
file.]

<h3 class="subsection">10.4.3 Quick and inconsistent compilation</h3>

<p>Coq now supports two different modes for speeding up compilation
at the price of consistency. Since Coq 8.11, <code>-vos</code> compiles
interfaces into <code>.vos</code> files and since Coq 8.5
<code>-quick</code>/<code>-vio</code> produces <code>.vio</code> files. Proof
General supports both modes with parallel asynchronous
compilation, but exclusively, depending on the detected Coq
version. For Coq 8.11 or newer only <code>-vos</code> can be used.
There are a number of different compilation options supported,
see below.
</p>
<p>For Coq 8.11 or newer (decided by the automatic Coq version
detection of Proof General or by the setting
<code>coq-pinned-version</code>) required modules are either compiled
to <code>.vo</code> or <code>.vos</code> files, depending on the setting
<code>coq-compile-vos</code>, which can also be set on menu <code>Coq
-&gt; Auto Compilation -&gt; vos compilation</code>. There are four choices:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt> <code>vos-and-vok</code></dt>
<dd><p>First compile using <code>-vos</code>, skipping proofs. When
compilation finished, run <code>coqc -vok</code> in a second stage to
check proofs on all files that require it. Some universe
constraints might be missed, rendering this method possibly
inconsistent.
</p></dd>
<dt> <code>vos</code></dt>
<dd><p>Only compile using <code>-vos</code>, skipping proofs. No <code>coqc
-vok</code> run to check proofs. Obviously inconsistent.
</p></dd>
<dt> <code>ensure-vo</code></dt>
<dd><p>Compile without <code>-vos</code> to <code>.vo</code> files, checking all
proofs and universe constraints. Only consistent choice.
</p></dd>
<dt> unset (<code>nil</code>)</dt>
<dd><p>Compile with <code>-vos</code> if <code>coq-compile-quick</code> (see below)
equals <code>quick-no-vio2vo</code>. Otherwise compile without
<code>-vos</code> to <code>.vo</code>. This value provides an upgrade path
for users that configured <code>coq-compile-quick</code> in the past.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>For <code>vos-and-vok</code> the second <code>-vok</code> stage runs
asynchronously <code>coq-compile-second-stage-delay</code> seconds
after the last <code>Require</code> command has been processed. Errors
might pop up later and interrupt your normal interaction with
Coq. Because the second stage is not time critical, it runs on
<code>coq-max-background-second-stage-percentage</code> per cent of the
cores configured for the first stage. When
<code>coq-compile-keep-going</code> is configured and an error occurs,
the second <code>-vok</code> stage is run on those dependencies not
affected by the error.
</p>
<p>For Coq version 8.5 until before 8.11, Proof General supports
quick or vio compilation with parallel asynchronous compilation.
There are 4 modes that can be
configured with <code>coq-compile-quick</code> or by selecting one of
the radio buttons in the <code>Coq -&gt; Auto Compilation -&gt; Quick
compilation</code> menu. For Coq before 8.11 <code>coq-compile-vos</code> is
ignored.
</p>
<p>Value <code>no-quick</code> was provided for the transition, for those
that have not switched there development to
<code>Proof using</code>. Use <code>quick-no-vio2vo</code>, if you want quick
recompilation without producing .vo files. Option
<code>quick-and-vio2vo</code> recompiles with <code>-quick</code>/<code>-vio</code> as
<code>quick-no-vio2vo</code> does, but schedules a second vio2vo stage
for missing <code>.vo</code> files. Finally, use
<code>ensure-vo</code> for only importing <code>.vo</code> files with
complete universe checks. 
</p>
<p>Note that with all of <code>no-quick</code>, <code>quick-no-vio2vo</code> and
<code>quick-and-vio2vo</code> your development might be unsound because
proofs might have been skipped and
universe constraints are not fully present in <code>.vio</code> files.
</p>
<p>There are a few peculiarities of quick compilation in Coq 8.5
and possibly also in other versions.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Quick compilation runs noticeably slower when section
variables are not declared via <code>Proof using</code>.
</li><li>
Even when section variables are declared, quick compilation runs
slower on very small files, probably because of the
comparatively big size of the <code>.vio</code> files. You can speed up
quick compilation noticeably by running on a RAM disk.
</li><li>
If both, the <code>.vo</code> and the <code>.vio</code> files are present,
Coq loads the more recent one, regardless of whether
<code>-quick</code>, and emits a warning when the <code>.vio</code> is more
recent than the <code>.vo</code>.
</li><li>
Under some circumstances, files compiled when only the
<code>.vio</code> file of some library was present are not compatible
with (other) files compiled when also the <code>.vo</code> file of that
library was present, see Coq issue #5223 for details. As a rule
of thumb one should run vio2vo compilation only before or after
library loading.
</li><li>
Apart from the previous point, Coq works fine when libraries are
present as a mixture of <code>.vio</code> and <code>.vo</code> files. While
<code>make</code> insists on building all prerequisites as either
<code>.vio</code> or <code>.vo</code> files, Proof General just checks
whether an up-to-date compiled library file is present.
</li><li>
To ensure soundness, all library dependencies must be compiled as
<code>.vo</code> files and loaded into one Coq instance.
</li></ul>

<p>Detailed description of the 4 possible settings of
<code>coq-compile-quick</code>:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt> <code>no-quick</code></dt>
<dd><p>Compile outdated prerequisites without <code>-quick</code>, producing <code>.vo</code>
files, but don&rsquo;t compile prerequisites for which an up-to-date
<code>.vio</code> file exists. Delete or overwrite outdated <code>.vo</code> files.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>quick-no-vio2vo</code></dt>
<dd><p>Compile outdated prerequisites with <code>-quick</code>, producing <code>.vio</code>
files, but don&rsquo;t compile prerequisites for which an up-to-date
<code>.vo</code> file exists. Delete or overwrite outdated <code>.vio</code> files.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>quick-and-vio2vo</code></dt>
<dd><p>Same as <code>quick-no-vio2vo</code>, but start a second vio2vo stage for
missing <code>.vo</code> files. Everything described previously for the
second <code>-vok</code> stage applies here as well.
</p>
<p><em>Warning</em>: This mode does only work when you process require
commands in batches. Slowly single-stepping through require&rsquo;s
might lead to inconsistency errors when loading some libraries,
see Coq issue #5223. To mitigate this risk, vio2vo compilation
only starts after a certain delay after the last require command
of the current queue region has been processed. This is
controlled by <code>coq-compile-second-stage-delay</code>, <a href="#Customizing-Coq-Multiple-File-Support">Customizing Coq Multiple File Support</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>ensure-vo</code></dt>
<dd><p>Ensure that all library dependencies are present as <code>.vo</code>
files and delete outdated <code>.vio</code> files or <code>.vio</code> files
that are more recent than the corresponding <code>.vo</code> file. This
setting is the only one that ensures soundness.
</p></dd>

<p>The options <code>no-quick</code> and <code>ensure-vo</code> are compatible
with Coq 8.4 or older. When Proof General detects such an older
Coq version, it changes the quick compilation mode automatically.
For this to work, the option <code>coq-compile-quick</code> must only
be set via the customization system or via the menu.

<h2 class="section">10.5 Omitting proofs for speed</h2>
<a class="anchor" id="index-Omitting-proofs-for-speed"></a>

<p>To speed up asserting larger chunks, Proof General can omit complete
opaque proofs by silently replacing the whole proof script with
<code>Admitted</code>, <a href="/doc/master/userman/Basic-Script-Management#Script-processing-commands">Script processing commands</a>. For files with big
proofs this can bring down the processing time to 10% with the obvious
disadvantage that errors in the omitted proofs go unnoticed.
</p>
<p>The omit-proof feature works when
</p><ul>
<li>
proofs are not nested
</li><li>
opaque and non-opaque proofs start with <code>Proof.</code> or
<code>Proof using</code>
</li><li>
opaque proofs end with <code>Qed</code> or <code>Admitted</code>
</li><li>
non-opaque proofs or definition end with <code>Defined</code>
</li></ul>
<p>Aborted proofs can be present if they start with a variant of
<code>Proof</code> and end with <code>Abort</code>. They are handled like
non-opaque proofs (i.e., not omitted).
</p>
<p>To enable omitting proofs, configure
<code>proof-omit-proofs-option</code> or select <code>Proof-General -&gt;
Quick Options -&gt; Processing -&gt; Omit Proofs</code>.
</p>
<p>For both, <code>proof-goto-point</code> and <code>proof-process-buffer</code>, a
prefix argument toggles the omit-proofs feature for one invocation.
</p>
<p>If a nested proof is detected while searching for opaque proofs
to omit, a warning is displayed and the complete remainder of the
asserted region is sent unmodified to Coq. 
</p>
<p>If the proof script relies on sections, it is highly recommended to use
a <code>Proof using</code> annotation for all lemmas contained in a Section,
otherwise <code>Coq</code> will compute a wrong type for these lemmas when
this omitting-proofs feature is enabled.
</p>
<p>To automate this, we recall that ProofGeneral provides a dedicated
feature to generate these <code>Proof using</code> annotations (a defective
form being e.g. <code>Proof using Type</code> if no section hypothesis is
used), see the menu command <code>Coq &gt; &quot;Proof using&quot; mode</code> and
<a href="#Proof-using-annotations">Proof using annotations</a> for details.
</p>
<p>Note that the omit-proof feature works by examining the asserted
region with different regular expressions to recognize proofs and to
differentiate opaque from non-opaque proofs. This approach is
necessarily imprecise and the omit-proofs feature may therefore cause
unexpected errors in the proof script. Currently, Proof General
correctly handles the following cases for Coq.
</p><ul>
<li>
Commands, such as <code>Hint</code>, that may appear inside proofs but may
have effects outside the proof cause the proof to be considered as
non-opaque.
</li><li>
A <code>Let</code> declaration followed by a proof to supply the term causes
this proof to be considered as non-opaque. Note that such declarations
are only handled correctly if the <code>Let</code> and the proof are
asserted together. If the proof is asserted separately it may be
treated as opaque and thus be omitted.
</li></ul>

<p>The following cases are currently not handled correctly.
</p><ul>
<li>
All capitalized commands make Proof General believe the proof is
non-opaque, even if they have proof-local effect only, such as
<code>Focus</code> or <code>Unshelve</code>.

<p>The command <code>proof-check-annotate</code> (menu <code>Proof-General -&gt;
Annotate Failing Proofs</code>) can then be used to consistently annotate
failing proofs with a <code>FAIL</code> comment or to check, e.g., in
continuous integration, that such comments are present.

<h2 class="section">10.7 Editing multiple proofs</h2>

<p>Coq allows the user to enter top-level commands while editing a proof
script.  For example, if the user realizes that the current proof will
fail without an additional axiom, he or she can add that axiom to the
system while in the middle of the proof.  Similarly, the user can
nest lemmas, beginning a new lemma while in the middle of an earlier
one, and as the lemmas are proved or their proofs aborted they are
popped off a stack.
</p>
<p>Coq Proof General supports this feature of Coq.  Top-level commands
entered while in a proof are well backtracked. If new lemmas are
started, Coq Proof General lets the user work on the proof of the new
lemma, and when the lemma is finished it falls back to the previous
one.  This is supported to any nesting depth that Coq allows.
</p>
<p>Warning! Using Coq commands for navigating inside the different proofs
(<code>Resume</code> and especially <code>Suspend</code>) are not supported,
backtracking will break synchronization.
</p>
<p><b>Special note:</b> The old feature that moved nested proofs outside the
current proof is disabled.

<a class="anchor" id="User_002dloaded-tactics-1"></a>
<h2 class="section">10.8 User-loaded tactics</h2>

<p>Another feature that Coq allows is the extension of the grammar of the
proof assistant by new tactic commands.  This feature interacts with the
proof script management of Proof General, because Proof General needs to
know when a tactic is called that alters the proof state.  When the user
tries to retract across an extended tactic in a script, the algorithm
for calculating how far to undo has a default behavior that is not
always accurate in proof mode: do &quot;<code>Undo</code>&quot;.
</p>
<p>Coq Proof General does not currently support dynamic tactic extension in
Coq: this is desirable but requires assistance from the Coq core.
Instead we provide a way to add tactic and command names in the
&lsquo;<tt>.emacs</tt>&rsquo; file. Four Configurable variables allows to register
personal new tactics and commands into four categories:
</p><ul>
<li> <em>state changing commands</em>, 
which need &quot;<code>Back</code>&quot; to be backtracked;
</li><li> <em>state changing tactics</em>,
which need &quot;<code>Undo</code>&quot; to be backtracked; 
</li><li> <em>state preserving commands</em>,
which do not need to be backtracked; 
</li><li> <em>state preserving tactics</em>,
which do not need to be backtracked; 
</li></ul>

<p>We give an example of existing commands that fit each category.
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>coq-user-state-preserving-commands</code>: example: &quot;<code>Print</code>&quot;

</li><li> <code>coq-user-state-changing-commands</code>: example: &quot;<code>Require</code>&quot;

</li><li> <code>coq-user-state-changing-tactics</code>: example: &quot;<code>Intro</code>&quot;
 
</li><li> <code>coq-user-state-preserving-tactics</code>: example: &quot;<code>Idtac</code>&quot;
</li></ul>

<p>This variables are regexp string lists. See their documentations in
emacs (<code>C-h v coq-user...</code>)  for details on how to set them in your
&lsquo;<tt>.emacs</tt>&rsquo; file.
</p>
<p>Here is a simple example:
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="lisp">(setq coq-user-state-changing-commands 
      '(&quot;MyHint&quot; &quot;MyRequire&quot;))
(setq coq-user-state-preserving-commands 
      '(&quot;Show\\s-+Mydata&quot;))
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>The regexp character sequence <code>\\s-+</code> means &quot;one or more
whitespaces&quot;. See the Emacs documentation of <code>regexp-quote</code> for the
syntax and semantics.  WARNING: you need to restart Emacs to make the
changes to these variables effective.
</p>
<p>In case of losing synchronization, the user can use <kbd>C-c C-z</kbd> to
move the locked region to the proper position,
(<code>proof-frob-locked-end</code>, see section <a href="/doc/master/userman/Advanced-Script-Management-and-Editing#Escaping-script-management">Escaping script management</a>) or
<kbd>C-c C-v</kbd> to re-issue an erroneously back-tracked tactic without
recording it in the script.

<a class="anchor" id="Indentation-tweaking-1"></a>
<h2 class="section">10.9 Indentation tweaking</h2>

<p>Indentation of Coq script is provided by Proof General, but it may
behave badly especially if you use syntax extensions. You can sometimes
fix this problem by telling PG that some token should be considered as
identical to other ones by the indentation mechanism. Use the two
variables <code>coq-smie-user-tokens</code> and
<code>coq-smie-monadic-tokens</code>. This variables contains associations
between user tokens and the existing pg tokens they should be equated
too.
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>coq-smie-user-tokens</code>

<p>this is where users should put ther own tokens. For instance:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="lisp">(setq coq-smie-user-tokens '((\&quot;xor\&quot; . \&quot;or\&quot;) (\&quot;ifb\&quot; . \&quot;if\&quot;)))
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>to have token \&quot;xor\&quot; and \&quot;ifb\&quot; be considered as having
</p></li><li> <code>coq-smie-monadic-tokens</code>

<p>is specific to monadic operators: it contains usual monadic notations
by default (but you can redefine it if needed).
</p>
<p>Specific tokens are defined for the two usual monadic forms: 
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">&quot;let monadic&quot; E &quot;&lt;- monadic&quot; E &quot;in monadic&quot; E
E &quot;&lt;- monadic&quot; E &quot;;; monadic&quot; E
</pre>
<p>The default value of <code>coq-smie-monadic-tokens</code> gives the following
concrete syntax to these tokens:
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="lisp">((&quot;;;&quot; . &quot;;; monadic&quot;)
 (&quot;do&quot; . &quot;let monadic&quot;)
 (&quot;&lt;-&quot; . &quot;&lt;- monadic&quot;)
 (&quot;;&quot; . &quot;in monadic&quot;))
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>thus allowing for the following:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">  do x &lt;- foo;
  do y &lt;- bar;
  ...
</pre><p>and
</p><pre class="verbatim">  x &lt;- foo;;
  y &lt;- bar;;
  ...
</pre></li></ul>

<p><em>NOTE:</em> This feature is experimental.
</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> the &ldquo;pg tokens&rdquo; are actually the ones PG generates internally by
exploring the file around the indentation point. Consequently this
refers to internals of PoofGeneral. Contact the Proof General team if you
need help.

<a class="anchor" id="Holes-feature-1"></a>
<h2 class="section">10.10 Holes feature</h2>

<p><em>Holes</em> are an experimental feature for complex expression editing
by filling in templates. It is inspired from other tools, like Pcoq
(<a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/lemme/pcoq/index.html">http://www-sop.inria.fr/lemme/pcoq/index.html</a>).  The principle
is simple, holes are pieces of text that can be &quot;filled&quot; by various
means. The Coq command insertion menu system makes use of the holes
system.  Almost all holes operations are available in the Holes menu.
</p>
<p><b>Notes:</b> Holes make use of the Emacs abbreviation mechanism, it will
work without problem if you don&rsquo;t have an abbrev table defined for Coq
in your config files.  Use <code>C-h v abbrev-file-name</code> to see the name
of the abbreviation file. 
</p>
<p>If you already have such a table it won&rsquo;t be automatically overwritten
(so that you keep your own abbreviations).  But you must read the abbrev
file given in the Proof General sources to be able to use the command
insertion menus.  You can do the following to merge your abbreviations
with ProofGeneral&rsquo;s abbreviations: <code>M-x read-abbrev-file</code>, then
select the file named <code>coq-abbrev.el</code> in the
<code>ProofGeneral/coq</code> directory. At Emacs exit you will be asked if
you want to save abbrevs; answer yes.

<h2 class="section">10.11 Proof-Tree Visualization</h2>
<a class="anchor" id="index-Proof_002dTree-visualization"></a>

<p>Starting with Proof General version 4.5 and Coq version 8.11, Coq
Proof General has (again) full support for proof-tree visualization, 
see section <a href="/doc/master/userman/Graphical-Proof_002dTree-Visualization#Graphical-Proof_002dTree-Visualization">Graphical Proof-Tree Visualization</a>. To find out which
versions of Prooftree are compatible with this version of Proof
General, see section <a href="/doc/master/userman/Graphical-Proof_002dTree-Visualization#Graphical-Proof_002dTree-Visualization">Graphical Proof-Tree Visualization</a> or the 
<a href="http://askra.de/software/prooftree/">Prooftree website</a>.
</p>
<p>For the visualization to work properly, proofs must be started
with <code>Proof</code>, which is encouraged practice anyway (see Coq Bug
#2776). Without <code>Proof</code> you lose the initial proof goal,
possibly having two or more initial goals in the display.
</p>
<p>To support <code>Grab Existential Variables</code> Prooftree can
actually display several graphically independent proof trees in
several layers.

<a class="anchor" id="index-coq_002dshow_002dproof_002dstepwise"></a>

<p>Coq 8.10 supports automatically highlighting the differences
between successive proof steps in Proof General.  The feature is described in the
Coq Documentation, section <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/distrib/current/refman/proofs/writing-proofs/proof-mode.html#showing-differences-between-proof-steps">Showing differences between proof steps</a>.
</p>
<p>The Coq proof diff does more than a basic &quot;diff&quot; operation.  For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li> diffs are computed on a per-token basis (as determined by the Coq lexer) rather
  than on a per-character basis, probably a better match for how people understand
  the output.  (For example, a token-based diff between &quot;abc&quot; and &quot;axc&quot; will
  highlight all of &quot;abc&quot; and &quot;axc&quot; as a difference, while a character-based diff
  would indicate that &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are in common and that only the &quot;b&quot;/&quot;x&quot; is a
  difference.)
</li><li> diffs ignore the order of hypotheses
</li><li> tactics that only change the proof view are handled specially, for
  example &quot;swap&quot; after a &quot;split&quot; will show the diffs between before &quot;split&quot;
  and after &quot;swap&quot;, which is more useful
</li><li> some error messages have been instrumented to show diffs where it is helpful
</li></ul>

<p>To enable or disable diffs, set <code>coq-diffs</code> (select menu <code>Coq -&gt; Diffs</code>)
to &quot;on&quot;, &quot;off&quot; or &quot;removed&quot;.  &quot;on&quot; highlights added tokens with the background
color from <code>diff-refine-added</code>.  &quot;removed&quot; highlights removed tokens
with the background color from <code>diff-refine-removed</code>.  With the &quot;removed&quot; setting,
lines that have both added and removed text may be shown twice, as &quot;before&quot; and
&quot;after&quot; lines.
To preserve the settings for the next time you start Proof General,
select <code>Coq -&gt; Settings -&gt; Save Settings</code>.
</p>
<p>The colors used to highlight diffs are configurable in the
<code>Proof-General -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Customize -&gt; Proof Faces</code> menu.
The 4 <code>Coq Diffs ...</code> faces control the highlights.  Lines that
have added or removed tokens are shown with the entire line highlighted with
a <code>Coq Diffs ... Bg</code> face.  The added or removed tokens themselves are highlighted
with non-<code>Bg</code> faces.

<p>Coq can be installed using <code>opam</code> (the OCaml package manager),
which makes it easy to manage several different switches, having each
a different version of Coq.
</p>
<p>Instead of running a command like <code>opam switch ...</code> in a terminal
and restarting emacs to benefit from a different switch, one can:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Install</b> the
<a href="https://github.com/ProofGeneral/opam-switch-mode">opam-switch-mode</a> and use the dedicated mode bar menu <code>OPSW</code> it
provides.
</li><li>
<b>Configure</b> Proof General using the customization option
<code>coq-kill-coq-on-opam-switch</code>, so that the Coq background process
is killed when changing the opam switch through
<code>opam-switch-mode</code>.
</li></ul>

<dd><p>If t kill coq when the opam switch changes (requires &lsquo;<samp>opam-switch-mode</samp>&rsquo;).<br>
When &lsquo;<samp>opam-switch-mode</samp>&rsquo; is loaded and the user changes the opam switch
through &lsquo;<samp>opam-switch-mode</samp>&rsquo; then this option controls whether the coq
background process (the proof shell) is killed such that the next
