<h2 class="unnumberedsec">News for Version 4.0</h2>
<a class="anchor" id="index-news-6"></a>

<p>Proof General version 4.0 is a major overhaul of Proof General.
The main changes are:
</p><ul>
<li> support for GNU Emacs only, <b>you cannot use XEmacs any more</b>;
</li><li> a new <b>Unicode Tokens</b> mode, which now replaces X-Symbol,
      see section <a href="/doc/master/userman/Unicode-symbols-and-special-layout-support#Unicode-symbols-and-special-layout-support">Unicode symbols and special layout support</a>;
</li><li> to allow &ldquo;document centred&rdquo; working, annotating scripts with prover output
      and automatically sending commands to the prover, see section <a href="/doc/master/userman/Advanced-Script-Management-and-Editing#Document-centred-working">Document centred working</a>;
</li><li> support for latest versions of provers (Isabelle2009-2 and Coq 8.2);
</li><li> numerous smaller enhancements and efficiency improvements.
</li></ul>

<p>See the &lsquo;<tt>CHANGES</tt>&rsquo; file in the distribution for more complete
details of changes, and the appendix <a href="/doc/master/userman/History-of-Proof-General#History-of-Proof-General">History of Proof General</a> for

<p>The aim of the Proof General project is to provide powerful environments
and tools for interactive proof.
</p>
<p>Proof General has been Emacs based so far and uses heavy per-prover
customisation.  The <b>Proof General Kit</b> project proposes that proof
assistants use a <i>standard</i> XML-based protocol for interactive proof,
dubbed <b>PGIP</b>.  PGIP will enable middleware for interactive proof
tools and interface components.  Rather than configuring Proof General
for your proof assistant, you will need to configure your proof
assistant to understand PGIP.  There is a similarity however; the design
of PGIP was based heavily on the Emacs Proof General framework.
</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the Proof General Kit software is in a prototype
stage and the PGIP protocol is still being refined.  We have a prototype
Proof General plugin for the Eclipse IDE and a prototype version of a
PGIP-enabled Isabelle.  There is also a middleware component for
co-ordinating proof written in Haskell, the <i>Proof General Broker</i>.
Further collaborations are sought for more developments, especially the
PGIP enabling of other provers.  For more details, see
<a href="http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/kit">the Proof General Kit webpage</a>.  Help us to help you organize your proofs!

<p>The original developers of the basis of Proof General were:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>David Aspinall</b>,
</li><li> <b>Healfdene Goguen</b>,
</li><li> <b>Thomas Kleymann</b>, and
</li><li> <b>Dilip Sequeira</b>.
</li></ul>

<p>LEGO Proof General (the successor of <code>lego-mode</code>) was written by
Thomas Kleymann and Dilip Sequeira.  It is no longer maintained.
Coq Proof General was written by Healfdene Goguen, with
later contributions from Patrick Loiseleur.
It is now maintained by Pierre Courtieu.
Isabelle Proof General was written and is being maintained by David
Aspinall.  It has benefited greatly from tweaks and suggestions by
Markus Wenzel, who wrote the first support for Isar and added Proof
General support inside Isabelle.  David von Oheimb supplied the
original patches for X-Symbol support, which improved Proof General
significantly.  Christoph Wedler, the author of X-Symbol, provided
much useful support in adapting his package for PG.
</p>
<p>The generic base for Proof General was developed by Kleymann, Sequeira,
Goguen and Aspinall. It follows some of the ideas used in Project
<a href="http://www.inria.fr/croap/">CROAP</a>. The project to implement a
proof mode for LEGO was initiated in 1994 and coordinated until October
1998 by Thomas Kleymann, becoming generic along the way.  In October
1998, the project became Proof General and has been managed by David
Aspinall since then.
</p>
<p>This manual was written by David Aspinall and Thomas Kleymann, with
words borrowed from user documentation of LEGO mode, prepared by Dilip
Sequeira.  Healfdene Goguen wrote some text for Coq Proof General.
Since Proof General 2.0, this manual has been maintained by David
Aspinall, with contributions from Pierre Courtieu, Markus Wenzel
and Hendrik Tews.
</p>
<p>The Proof General project has benefited from (indirect) funding by EPSRC
(<i>Applications of a Type Theory Based Proof Assistant</i> in the late
1990s and <i>The Integration and Interaction of Multiple Mathematical
Reasoning Processes</i>, EP/E005713/1 (RA0084) in 2006-8), the EC (the
Co-ordination Action <i>Types</i> and previous related projects), and the
support of the LFCS.  Version 3.1 was prepared whilst David Aspinall was
visiting ETL, Japan, supported by the British Council.  
</p>
<p>For Proof General 3.7, Graham Dutton helped with web pages and
infrastructure; since then the the computing support team at the School
of Informatics have given help.  For testing and feedback for older
versions of Proof General, thanks go to Rod Burstall, Martin Hofmann,
and James McKinna, and several on the longer list below.
</p>
<p>For the Proof General 4.0 release, special thanks go to Stefan Monnier
for patches and suggestions, to Makarius for many bug reports and help
with Isabelle support and to Pierre Courtieu for providing new
features for Coq support.
</p>
<p>Between Proof General 4.3 and 4.4 releases, the PG sources have been
migrated from CVS to to GitHub; special thanks go to Clement
Pit&ndash;Claudel for help in this migration.
</p>
<p>Proof General 4.4&rsquo;s new icons were contributed by Yoshihiro Imai
(<a href="http://proofcafe.org/wiki/Generaltan">http://proofcafe.org/wiki/Generaltan</a>) under CC-BY-SA 3.0

</p>
<p>During the development of Proof General 3.x and 4.x releases, 
many people helped provide testing and other feedback, 
including the Proof General maintainers,
Paul Callaghan, Pierre Courtieu, and Markus Wenzel, 
Stefan Berghofer, Gerwin Klein, and other folk who
tested pre-releases or sent bug reports and patches, including 
Cuihtlauac Alvarado,
