## Related Projects, Present and Past

-   [ProofWeb](http://prover.cs.ru.nl/wiki.php) is a web-based interface
    to interactive theorem provers run on a server. It is being enhanced
    towards a Wiki for formalized mathematics.
-   [I3P](http://www-pu.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/i3p/) is an
    IDE-based interface for Isabelle using Proof
    General-style interaction. It's perhaps in a more robust state than
    our own [Proof General Eclipse](http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/eclipse) prototype.
-   As a possible foundation for generic proof environments,
    [OpenMath](http://www.openmath.org/society/) is a
    standard representation form for mathematical objects, which links
    in with the [MathML](http://www.w3.org/Math/) markup language.
-   [Prosper](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/prosper/) was a project to
    develop an extensible, open proof tool architecture for
    incorporating formal verification into industrial CAD/CASE tool
    flows and design methodologies. The tools include novel
    user-friendly interfaces.
-   [Isamode](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/da/Isamode) was an XEmacs
    front-end for Isabelle. It had a different feature collection
    compared with Proof General: script management wasn't supported, but
    menus and shortcuts provided one of the first widely used enhanced
    interfaces for Isabelle.
-   [CtCoq](http://www-sop.inria.fr/croap/ctcoq/ctcoq-eng.html) was an
    interface for the Coq theorem prover, developed at INRIA, Sophia
    Antipolis, as part of [Projet
    CROAP](http://www-sop.inria.fr/croap/). Like Proof General, CtCoq
    used a general approach for building user-interfaces for
    theorem provers. Unlike Proof General, CtCoq is based on a graphical
    environment with structure editing, created with the
    [Centaur](http://www-sop.inria.fr/croap/centaur/centaur.html) system.
-   [OMEGA](http://www.ags.uni-sb.de/~omega/) is a collection of
    web-based distributed tools for supporting theorem proving.
